# Single Trip Page UI/UX Improvement Plan

This document outlines the proposed plan to enhance the user interface and user experience of the single trip page.

## Current State Analysis

The current single trip page displays basic information such as title, duration, price, description, cost inclusions/exclusions, itineraries, and FAQs in a linear layout.

## Areas for Improvement

Based on the analysis, the following areas have been identified for improvement:

*   **Visual Hierarchy and Layout:** Improve the visual structure to highlight key information and guide user flow.
*   **Trip Highlights:** Prominently display key features and selling points of the trip.
*   **Itinerary Presentation:** Enhance the presentation of the daily itinerary for better readability and interaction.
*   **Cost Breakdown:** Improve the formatting of cost inclusions and exclusions.
*   **Call to Action:** Add a clear and accessible call to action for booking or inquiry.
*   **Image Gallery:** Potentially add a gallery to showcase multiple trip images.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness:** Ensure optimal display and functionality on all devices.

## Proposed UI/UX Enhancements

The following enhancements are proposed to address the identified areas for improvement:

1.  **Enhance Hero Section:**
    *   Utilize the featured image as a prominent background for the top section of the page.
    *   Overlay the trip title, duration, and price in a clear and visually appealing manner on top of the background image.

2.  **Add Overview Section:**
    *   Create a dedicated section below the hero to provide a concise overview of the trip.
    *   Include the main trip description.
    *   Extract and display key highlights from the trip data, such as the countries visited and major activities mentioned in the description or itineraries. Use relevant icons to make these highlights easily scannable.

3.  **Improve Itinerary Presentation:**
    *   Transform the current simple list of itineraries into a more interactive format.
    *   Implement each day's itinerary as a collapsible section (like an accordion), showing only the title initially and allowing users to expand for details. This helps manage content length and improves navigation.

4.  **Format Inclusions/Exclusions:**
    *   Present the "What's Included" and "What's Not Included" information in two distinct, clearly labeled lists.
    *   Use bullet points or icons to enhance readability and make it easy for users to quickly understand what is covered in the price.

5.  **Implement FAQ Accordion:**
    *   Similar to the itinerary, present the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) using a collapsible accordion structure. This keeps the FAQ section organized and prevents it from overwhelming the page if there are many questions.

6.  **Add Prominent Call to Action:**
    *   Integrate a clear and easily accessible "Inquire Now" or "Book Now" button.
    *   Consider making this button sticky so it remains visible as the user scrolls down the page, encouraging conversions.

7.  **Consider Image Gallery:**
    *   If the trip data structure allows for multiple images beyond just a single featured image, add an image gallery section to showcase more visuals of the destinations and activities.

8.  **Ensure Mobile Responsiveness:**
    *   Throughout the design and implementation process, prioritize mobile responsiveness to ensure the page looks and functions well on various devices.

## Implementation Plan

1.  **Detailed Design:** Create a more detailed design or wireframe based on the approved plan.
2.  **Code Implementation:** Modify the `src/pages/trips/[slug].js` file and the associated SCSS file (`src/styles/pages/SingleTrip.module.scss`) to implement the approved design. This will involve updating the JSX structure and styling.
3.  **Testing:** Test the updated page for functionality and responsiveness across different devices.
