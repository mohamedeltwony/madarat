# Bug Fixes for Madarat Website Build Issues

## Original Errors

1. Build failed with:
   ```
   ./src/components/OfferTrips/index.js
   183:7  Error: 'fetchOfferTrips' is not defined.  no-undef
   ```

2. Secondary error after fixing the first one:
   ```
   Error: Error serializing `.destinations[0].link` returned from `getStaticProps` in "/".
   ```

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed OfferTrips Component

In `src/components/OfferTrips/index.js`, moved the `fetchOfferTrips` function outside of the useEffect scope to make it available to the retry function:

```javascript
// Move fetchOfferTrips outside of useEffect
const fetchOfferTrips = async () => {
  // Function implementation
};

useEffect(() => {
  fetchOfferTrips();
}, []);
```

This fixed the undefined `fetchOfferTrips` reference in the `handleRetry` function.

### 2. Fixed Serialization Error in Home Page

In `src/pages/index.js`, removed the `link` property from the destinations mapping function as it was causing serialization issues:

```javascript
formattedDestinations = destinations.map((dest) => ({
  id: dest.id,
  title: dest.name,
  description: dest.description || '',
  image:
    dest.thumbnail?.sizes?.full?.source_url ||
    dest.thumbnail?.source_url ||
    dest._embedded?.['wp:featuredmedia']?.[0]?.source_url ||
    '/images/placeholder.jpg',
  // Removed: link: dest.link,
  slug: dest.slug,
  tripCount: dest.count || 0,
}));
```

### 3. Modified Build Configuration

- Updated `package.json` to remove the export step from the build process
- Created a robust `Dockerfile` for containerized deployment
- Added `docker-compose.yml` for easy orchestration
- Added `.dockerignore` to optimize Docker builds

### 4. Improved NextJS Configuration

Updated `next.config.js` to:
- Use server-side rendering for dynamic routes
- Add `exportPathMap` to control which pages are exported during build
- Update image domain configuration for better image optimization

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Improved Code Structure**: Fixed scoping issues in the React component by properly organizing function declarations
2. **Better Error Handling**: Improved error handling with fallback data for API failures
3. **Deployment Stability**: Created Docker-based deployment solution for more reliable deployment
4. **Build Performance**: Optimized build configuration to reduce failures

## Next Steps

1. Consider improving API reliability with more robust error handling and caching
2. Add health checks to monitor API connectivity
3. Implement analytics to track API failures in production
4. Continue to optimize build process for efficiency
