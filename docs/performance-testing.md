# Performance Testing & Metrics

This document tracks performance metrics before and after the optimizations performed according to our [performance optimization plan](./performance-optimization-plan.md).

## Testing Methodology

We use Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools to measure performance metrics for key pages:

1. **Network Throttling**: Simulated Fast 3G
2. **CPU Throttling**: 4x slowdown
3. **Cache**: Disabled
4. **Metrics Captured**:
   - First Contentful Paint (FCP)
   - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
   - Time to Interactive (TTI)
   - Total Blocking Time (TBT)
   - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
   - Performance Score
   - First Meaningful Paint (FMP)
   - Speed Index

## Key Pages for Testing

1. Home Page (`/`)
2. Destinations Listing (`/destinations`)  
3. Trip Detail Page (`/trips/[slug]`)
4. Blog Posts Listing (`/posts`)
5. Single Blog Post (`/posts/[slug]`)

## Baseline Metrics (Before Optimizations)

| Page | Performance Score | FCP (s) | LCP (s) | TTI (s) | TBT (ms) | CLS | Speed Index (s) |
|------|------------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|-----|----------------|
| Home | TBD              | TBD     | TBD     | TBD     | TBD      | TBD | TBD            |
| Destinations | TBD      | TBD     | TBD     | TBD     | TBD      | TBD | TBD            |
| Trip Detail | TBD       | TBD     | TBD     | TBD     | TBD      | TBD | TBD            |
| Posts | TBD             | TBD     | TBD     | TBD     | TBD      | TBD | TBD            |
| Single Post | TBD       | TBD     | TBD     | TBD     | TBD      | TBD | TBD            |

## After Optimization Metrics

| Page | Performance Score | FCP (s) | LCP (s) | TTI (s) | TBT (ms) | CLS | Speed Index (s) |
|------|------------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|-----|----------------|
| Home | TBD              | TBD     | TBD     | TBD     | TBD      | TBD | TBD            |
| Destinations | TBD      | TBD     | TBD     | TBD     | TBD      | TBD | TBD            |
| Trip Detail | TBD       | TBD     | TBD     | TBD     | TBD      | TBD | TBD            |
| Posts | TBD             | TBD     | TBD     | TBD     | TBD      | TBD | TBD            |
| Single Post | TBD       | TBD     | TBD     | TBD     | TBD      | TBD | TBD            |

## Error Handling Test Results

We conducted tests to ensure the site remains functional even when the WordPress API is unavailable:

| Test Scenario | Expected Behavior | Result |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| WP API Timeout | Show cached data or fallback UI | TBD |
| WP API 500 Error | Show cached data or fallback UI | TBD |
| WP API Invalid Response | Handle gracefully with fallback | TBD |
