# Website Performance Optimization Plan (Hybrid Approach) - Final Phase

**Goal:** Improve website performance and reliability by minimizing WordPress dependencies while retaining dynamic content management for Trips, Destinations, and Posts.

**Summary:** This plan involves keeping the WordPress integration for essential dynamic content (Trips, Destinations, Posts) and removing dependencies for static or less frequently updated content (Menus, general Pages, Site Metadata), which will be managed locally within the Next.js project.

## Current Progress Summary

- ✅ **Decoupling Steps (Menus, Site Metadata, General Pages)**: Created local data structures and static pages
- ✅ **Configuration Updates**: Updated `next.config.js` with modern image configuration
- ✅ **WordPress API Stabilization**: All critical API endpoints are working properly (verified with tests)
- ✅ **Missing Images Fixed**: Added pattern.png and updated CSS to use existing hero-background.jpg
- ✅ **Removed Duplicate Pages**: Resolved the conflict between posts.js and posts/index.js
- ✅ **Google API Fallback**: Updated Google Reviews API to provide dummy data when the API key is missing
- ✅ **Fetching Logic Optimized**: Added in-memory caching and improved error handling
- ✅ **Service Worker Implementation**: Added offline support and caching strategies
- ✅ **Image Optimization**: Implemented lazy loading and shimmer placeholders
- ✅ **Code Splitting Implementation**: Added dynamic imports and React.lazy for heavy components
- ✅ **Dead Code Removal**: Eliminated unused imports and dependencies
- ✅ **Documentation**: Created documentation for hybrid architecture and optimizations

## Code Splitting and Optimization Summary

The following optimizations have been implemented:

1. **Heavy Component Lazy Loading**
   - Added dynamic imports for BentoDestinations, OfferTrips, and GoogleReviewsSection components
   - Implemented loading placeholders for better user experience during component loading

2. **UI Components Optimization**
   - Used React.lazy with Suspense for medium-sized UI components like SparkleButton
   - Created component-level fallbacks for improved loading experience

3. **Icon Library Optimization**
   - Created a centralized icons.js file that dynamically imports only the specific icons needed
   - Eliminated loading entire icon libraries when only a few icons are actually used

4. **Bundle Size Reduction**
   - Analyzed bundle with @next/bundle-analyzer to identify optimization opportunities
   - Implemented dynamic imports for non-critical components
   - Removed dead code and unused dependencies
   - Optimized client-side bundle by deferring non-critical JavaScript

## Detailed Steps with Progress

1.  **Stabilize Critical WordPress APIs:** ✅ Complete
    *   **Action:** Investigated the `500 Internal Server Error` reported in the logs.
    *   **Verification:** Confirmed all critical API endpoints are working properly:
        *   ✅ `/wp/v2/destination` (200 OK)
        *   ✅ `/wp/v2/trip` (200 OK)
        *   ✅ `/wp/v2/posts` (200 OK)

     * Home page
     * Destination listings
     * Trip details
     * Blog posts
   * Document performance metrics before and after optimizations for comparison
   * Test fallback behavior by simulating WordPress API outage:
     * Temporarily modify API URL to an invalid one
     * Verify graceful error handling works properly
     * Ensure site remains functional for non-API dependent parts

2. **Additional Optimizations:**
   * **Service Worker Implementation:**
